\textbf{Suppose we are given the minimum spanning tree $T$ of a given graph $G$ (with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges) and a new edge $e = (u - v)$ of weight $w$ that we will add to $G$. Give an efficient algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph $G + e$. Your algorithm should run in $O(n)$ time.}\vspace{.2cm}
